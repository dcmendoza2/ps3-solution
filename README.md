Student No format: 20xyabcde 
#### 1.

a. Graph the (i) Piecewise-Constant, Left-Endpoint Interpolant, (ii) Piecewise-Linear Interpolant, and (iii) Quadratic Interpolant
b. Approximate f(9.abcde) using (i) Piecewise-Constant, Left-Endpoint Interpolant, (ii) Piecewise-Linear Interpolant, and (iii) Quadratic Interpolant
c. Compute the error for your interpolation for each interpolant if

#### 2.
Do #1 but with h = 0.05, 0.025, 0.0125

#### 3. 
Given the same dataset and f(x) from #1, approximate f'(9.a) using:
a.	Forward difference (for h=0.1,0.05,0.025,and 0.125)
b.	Backward difference (for h=0.1,0.05,0.025,and 0.0125)
c.	Central difference (for h=0.1,0.05,0.025,and 0.0125)
d.	Compute the actual value of f'(9.α) and compute the error of your approximation.

#### 4. 	
Given the same dataset and f(x) from #1, approximate f''(9.a) using center difference formula for the second derivative for h=0.1,0.05,0.025,and 0.0125. Compute the actual value of f''(9.a) then compute the error of your approximation.


#### 5. 
Given the same dataset and f(x) from #1, approximate ∫_(9.a)^(9.a+0.2)f(x)dx using:
a.  Any of the rectangle rule (left, right, middle) for h=0.1,0.05,0.025,and 0.0125. 
b.	Trapezoidal rule for h=0.1,0.05,0.025,and 0.0125.
c.	Compute the actual value of ∫_(9.a)^(9.a+0.2)f(x)dx and compute the error of your approximation.
